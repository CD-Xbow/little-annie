### UPDATE - Little Annie Stands Alone.

Little Annie can now run out of the browser. Well, not really, it uses the Webview2 Chromium browser gadget and a wrapper coded in PureBasic 6. She seems to be happy with it.
There is a Little-Annie.exe and WebView2Loader.dll which must all be in the same folder as the web stuff for it to work, just as in the repo. 
For those interested the repo for Webview2 is here https://github.com/omegakode/PBWebview2, I used the browser_async example for the wrapper.

## Share and Enjoy!
