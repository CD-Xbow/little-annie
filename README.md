### UPDATE - Little Annie Stands Alone.

Little Annie can now run out of the browser. Well, not really, it uses the Webview2 Chromium browser gadget and a wrapper coded in PureBasic 6. She seems to be happy with it.
There is a Little-Annie.exe and WebView2Loader.dll which must all be in the same folder as the web stuff for it to work, just as in the repo. 
Windows 11 and 10 should run the exe alright as they should have werview2 built in, if not you can get it from here https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/?form=MA13LH
